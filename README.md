how to use the chatbot


----------------random responses------------------------------

when the chatbot wants to reply to your response. It will now search thought a list and choose a random response to display to the user. 

For example if you type:
user: give me tip on how I can protect myself my cyber attacks



----------------- Memory and recall -----------------------------
the chatbot can now remember what you are interested in. So when you start the chatbot, it will ask you what are interested in

Chatbot: what cybersecurity topic are you most interested in?
user: Password


Now as you continue to use the chatbot, and you mention 'password' again in one of your responses. It will pick it up and provide some topics based on passwords




-------------------Sentiment detection----------------------------
if you are feeling worried, curious or frustrated, the chatbot will give you some comfort. 

User: I am worried
Chatbot: It's completely understandable to feel that way. Scammers can be very convincing.
